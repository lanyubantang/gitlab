3. Choose if you want start a blank project, or with one of the predefined[Project Templates](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/project-templates): this will kickstart your repository code and CI automatically. Otherwise, if you have a project in a different repository, you can[import it](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/workflow/importing/README.html)by clicking on the**Import project**tab, provided this is enabled in your GitLab instance. Ask your administrator if not.

4. Provide the following information:

   * Enter the name of your project in the
     **Project name**
     field. You can't use special characters, but you can use spaces, hyphens, underscores or even emoji.
   * The
     **Project description \(optional\)**
     field enables you to enter a description for your project's dashboard, which will help others understand what your project is about. Though it's not required, it's a good idea to fill this in.
   * Changing the
     **Visibility Level**
     modifies the project's
     [viewing and access rights](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/public_access/public_access.html)
     for users.

5. Click**Create project**.
